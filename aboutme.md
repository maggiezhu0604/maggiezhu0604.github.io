# subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

I consider Madison, Wisconsin my home away from home. I spent three years and one summer there working at Bayer Crop Science on vegetable seed advancement, and I often feel fortunate that my first professional role brought me to Madison. I enjoyed the work itself, but even more than that, I grew to love the city—its people, accessible public resources, hiking trails, and natural beauty. During my time there, I was also able to lease a small piece of land to start gardening, which became how I spent much of my free time in the summers.

Before joining Bayer, I was a graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I earned my master’s degree in crop sciences.During that period, I had my first exposure to industry, working on a maize high-throughput phenotyping project. It was also when I began to ask myself what kind of work truly felt meaningful to me.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Environmental Systems at the University of California, San Diego—a campus I still hold a deep affection for. During my time at UC San Diego, I was fortunate to join Julian Schroeder’s Cell Biology lab, where I worked on a heavy-metal research project. My work focused on identifying heavy metal content in local community gardens and exploring potential mitigation strategies.

Outside of work and research, I enjoy reading history, visiting museums, running long distances, and writing—often about interesting ideas, everyday observations, and meaningful memories.
